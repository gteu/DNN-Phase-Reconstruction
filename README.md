# DNNPhaseReconstruction

This is an implementation of DNN-Phase-Reconstruction based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03474.

The repository is now under construction, and will be updated soon.
* switch Keras to Pytorch
* modify phase initialization
(The initial value for the Griffin-Lim algorithm needs to be the output of this model.)
